Consider the following scenario: a mother is trying to encourage her child to do the dishes at the end of every day. No matter how many times she expresses this to her child, they do not do the dishes. In this case, she wants to reinforce a particular behavior (washing the dishes). A great way to do this is to offer some sort of reward, like an allowance. If she were to give her child an allowance upon the successful washing of the dishes, she would find that this encourages her child to do their chores. This is an example prominent in psychology called positive reinforcement. In essence, positive reinforcement refers to the addition of something (in this example, an allowance) to reinforce a behavior (doing chores). This psychological phenomena is the logic that underpins reinforcement learning.

#### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning method that sits outside both supervised learning (which learns from a training set of labeled examples) and unsupervised learning (which identifies hidden structures from unlabeled data). Instead, reinforcement learning involves training an agent to learn how to make decisions to get the desired result through trial-and-error. The agent interacts with the environment, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its actions to maximize the total reward over time.

#### Reinforcement Learning: The Main Elements

There are **four** main elements in reinforcement learning:

1.  Policy: an agent's way of behaving at any given time

2.  Reward Signal: immediate reward following an action

3.  Value Function: the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate in the future, starting from the current state

4.  Model of Environment: allows for inferences of how the environment will behave, used for planning

#### Applications of Reinforcement Learning

#### K-Armed Bandits

![](k_armed_bandits.png)

A common reinforcement learning problem that has been studied for decades is the k-armed bandit problem. In this problem, our agent is in the room with k gambling machines (denoted as \"one-armed bandits\"). The agent is allowed a fixed number of pulls, n. During each pull, an arm may be pulled. There is no cost to use these bandits; the only negative reward associated with a pull is wasting that turn. When arm i is pulled, it pays off either 0 or 1, determined by an underlying probability parameter pi. These payoffs are independent and the pis are unknown. What is the best strategy for the agent?
